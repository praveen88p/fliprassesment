Siddhant made a special series and named it as G.F Series. The series follows this trend  Tn=(Tn-2)2-(Tn-1)  
in which the first and the second term are 0 and 1 respectively. Help Siddhant to find the first n terms of the series.

Note: Print a white space (" ") after every integer and a newline character after every testcase.

    // n = 6 , 5 ,4 ,3      output 0 1 -1 2 -1 5
    // n1 = 0, 1 ,-1, 2
    //  n2 =1, -1 , 2, -1
    // n3 = 0*0-1 = -1 -- 1*1- (-1) = 2 -- -1*-1-2 = -1 ---
